DINEOF_moveoneslice

#Typically one image to add at the end and drop image at start

# Fill in new image using DINEOF_OI

# Move data within the array (in place)

# DINEOFrun with restart and one EOF less than previous one and limit to one more EOF then previous one

# Once reconstructed, weighted average between old reconstruction and new reconstrucion. Weighting with a linear ramp ? So newest image mostly by corrent reconstrucion while older images basicall untouched by new reconstruction?

# Save oldest image on disc as best estimate ?
